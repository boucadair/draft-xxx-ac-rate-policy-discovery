1.  Introduction

   The document provides an analysis of proposed SCONE solutions.  The
   currently analyzed solutions (listed in alphabetic order) are as
   follows:

   MASQUE:  "MASQUE extension for signaling throughput advice"
      [I-D.ihlar-scone-masque-mediabitrate]

      See Section 3.2.

   NRLP:  "Discovery of Network Rate-Limit Policies (NRLPs)"
      [I-D.brw-scone-rate-policy-discovery]

      See Section 3.3.

   SCONE:  "A new QUIC version for network property communication"
      [I-D.joras-scone-quic-protocol]

      See Section 3.4.

   TRAIN:  "Transparent Rate Adaptation Indications for Networks (TRAIN)
      Protocol" [I-D.thomson-scone-train-protocol]

      See Section 3.5.

2.  Criteria Classification

   The following categories are used to classify the various criteria:

   Security (Sec):  Indicates whether this impacts security/privacy.
      Some of the criteria that are classified as security-related may
      also have implications on the efficiency of sharing an advice
      (e.g., as that is likely to be ignored).

   Deployability (Dep):  Captures a criteria that is important for
      unlocking the deployment of a solution at both network and host
      sides.

      A deployability hurdle would be typically the misalignment of
      incentives between those receiving the benefit vs. those bearing
      the cost of providing the benefit (Section 3.3 of
      [I-D.narten-radir-problem-statement]).  For example, the sender of
      the advice should see (immediate) benefits.

   Performance (Per):  May impact the performance of the network device
      that enables the solution and/or the performance of the flow.

   Service Interference (Int):  Captures implications on other services
      (e.g., side effects).

      For example, tweaking MTU may have an implication on all the flows
      that share the same network attachment, not only those that
      consumes an advice.  Likewise, requiring address sharing has a
      plenty of issues that are discussed in [RFC6269].  Also, relying
      upon an explicit proxy would penalize the proxy which could serve
      both good and 'bad' clients (e.g., launching Layer 7 DDoS
      attacks).

   Functional (Fun):  Characterizes the functional capabilities offered
      by activating a solution.

   A criterion may belong to one or more categories.

3.3.  NRLP

3.3.1.  Key Idea

   NRLP leverages existing discovery mechanisms (DHCP, RA, PvD) for
   networks to advertise throughout advices.  The same generic blob is
   used independent of the signaling mechanism.  NRLP operates within
   the existing network/host trust model.

   Also, NRLP does not introduce additional dependency that would hinder
   having the benefits of enabling the NRLP feature.

3.3.2.  Discussion

   Only network elements that are entitled to send DHCP/RA/PvD
   configuration are allowed to share the throughput advices.  As such,
   NRLP has built-in:

   *  Guard against random advice injection

   Taking into account that NRLP advices are bound to a traffic
   category, NLRP relies upon the OS to enforce the received policies
   for applications falling under a traffic category (or all traffic).
   In doing so, NRLP adheres to the following:

   *  Mobility (guard against changing 5-tuple)

   *  Require guards against app abuse: The OS can allocate network
      resources more fairly among different processes, with NRLP
      signals, ensuring that no single process monopolizes the network.

   NRLP meets the following criteria:

   *  Fate sharing: RA/DHCP are needed anyway so that connectivity is
      provided over a network attachment.  NRLP ensures that throughput
      advices shares the fare of the other network configuration on the
      host.

   *  Atomic configuration: Only one packet (e.g., RA) is required to
      share the advice.  Also, only a specific portion of the
      configuration can be provided.

   *  Updatability/Proactive signaling: It is possible to change the
      policy at any time and notify hosts (e.g., by sending a new RA).

   Given that NRLP advices are shared during the establishment of a
   network attachment and then as part of the maintenance of the
   attachment, NRLP is therefore:

   *  Applicable to any transport protocol: This allows specifically to
      ensure a feature parity for applications that fallback to another
      transport protocol (e.g., QUIC to TCP).

   *  Applicable to QUIC

   *  Applicable to any application

   To that aim aim, NRLP:

   *  Requires an OS API to expose the signal to applications, and
      ensure application fairness: An OS can provide more accurate
      available bandwidth to applications through the API, making
      implementation easier for applications that don't require
      dedicated bandwidth measurement.

   NRLP leverages existing mechanisms for the provisioning of network
   attachments, including supply of the various policies
   ([I-D.ietf-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit]).  Also, NRLP leverages AAA
   mechanisms (e.g., [RFC9445]).  Therefore, NRLP eases:

   *  Integration with network management tools

   One of NRLP flavors:

   *  Requires PvD discovery.  This is not required for DHCP/RA.

   NRLP does not restrict the deployment options as providers can deploy
   distributed or centralized DHCP servers, use relays, enable NRLP RA
   in access routers, etc.  Similar to other network configuration
   purposes, NRLP has the following capabilities:

   *  Support cascaded environments.  The throuput advice can even be
      correlated with local conditions or policies as shown, e.g., in
      Figure 1.

   *  Path coupled signaling

   *  Path decoupled signaling

                    Figure 1: Example of Cascaded NRLPs

   The same generic blob is used in NRLP independent of the signaling
   mechanism.  The blob is designed with the following key
   characteristics:

   *  Traffic direction (h2n, n2h, both): policies for one or both
      directions can be supplied.

   *  Per-host policies: An explicit indication in inserted in the
      advice to tag per-host policies.

   *  Per-subscriber policies: An explicit indication in inserted in the
      advice to tag per-subscriber policies.  This covers deployment
      scenarios such as tethering or CPE-based service offerings.

   *  Provide provisions for extensions: NLRP includes provisions for
      future attributes that are tracked in IANA registries.

   Given that NRLP leverages existing control plane mechanisms, NRLP
   does not:

   *  Require data plane upgrade/change

   *  Require transport payload inspection (network)

   *  Require transport payload inspection (host)

   Also, given that NRLP signals are exchanged before connection
   establishment, NRLP does not:

   *  Depend on the server to consume the signal: NRLP advices are
      immediately consumable by applications and do not require
      involving a remote server.

   *  Require the identity of the target server to receive or consume
      the advices.

   Moreover, NRLP does require any encapsulation or proxy function at
   the network.  As such, NRLP does not:

   *  Require steering policies on the host to decide which flows are
      eligible to the proxy service.

   *  Impact the connection setup delay: NRLP signals are available on
      bootstrap of a host (and prior to any connection establishment).

   *  Require MTU tweaking

   *  Incur multi-layer encryption

   *  Incur nested congestion control

   *  Incur multiple round-trips: The signal is immediately available in
      one packet (RA NRLP, typically).

   *  Overhead of unauthenticated re-encryption

   *  Forwarding performance impact

   *  IP address sharing issues: NRLP does not require changing the
      source IP address used by a host.

   *  Penalize any network node (a proxy, typically) which could serve
      bothgood and bad clients (e.g., launching Layer 7 DDoS attacks).

3.3.3.  Main Expected Gains

   *  Lower deployment barrier to experiment in large scale (no hardware
      or software change is needed in network components).

   *  Schedule network requests (independent of the transport protocol)
      more efficiently, preventing network congestion, and improving
      overall stability and network performance.

   *  Unlock new services in local networks and enhance the quality of
      experience at the LAN by providing a simple tool to communicate
      local policies to hosts.

   *  Provide a mechanism to assist networks managing the load at the
      source and, thus, contribute to better handle network overloads
      and optimize the use of resources under non nominal conditions.

3.3.4.  Costs

   *  A simple configuration is required for IPv4: DHCP flavor can be
      provided by configuration of custom options.  Refer to
      [NRLP-WIRE].

   *  A similar configuration approach can be followed for DHCPv6.

   *  A minor change to the network is required for NRLP RA: upgrade
      configuration of PE nodes with new Neighbor Discovery option.
      Note that all IPv6 hosts and networks are already required to
      support Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861].

   *  An API needs to be exposed on the host to share the advice with
      applications (e.g., scutil on MacOS).
