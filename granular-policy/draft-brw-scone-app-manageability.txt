1.  Introduction

1.1.  Context

   Connectivity services are provided by networks to customers via
   dedicated terminating points, such as customer edges (CEs) or User
   Equipment (UE).  To facilitate data transfer via the provider
   network, it is assumed that appropriate setup is provisioned over the
   links that connect customer terminating points and a provider network
   (usually via a Provider Edge (PE)), successfully allowing data
   exchange over these links.  The required setup is referred to in this
   document as network attachments, while the underlying link is
   referred to as "bearers".

   The bearer can be a physical or logical link that connects a customer
   device to a provider network.  A bearer can be a wireless or wired
   link.  The same or multiple bearer technologies can be used to
   establish the bearer (e.g., WLAN, cellular) to graft customer
   terminating points to a network.

      Network attachment is also known as "Attachment Circuit (AC)"
      which is an established concept in the industry and also in the
      IETF ([RFC4026], [RFC4664], [RFC4364], etc.).

   Figure 1 shows an example of a network that connects CEs and hosts
   (UE, for example).These CEs are servicing other (internal) hosts.
   The identification of these hosts is hidden from the network.  The
   policies enforced at the network for an AC are per-subscriber, not
   per-host.  Typically, if a CE is provided with a /56 IPv6 prefix,
   policies are enforced on that /56 not the individual /64s that will
   be used by internal hosts.  A customer terminating point may be
   serviced with one (e.g., UE#1, CE#1, and CE#3) or multiple ACs (e.g.,
   CE#2).

                    Figure 1: Sample Network Attachments

   Customer terminating points are provided with a set of information
   (e.g., IP address/prefix) to successfully be able to send and receive
   traffic over an AC.  A comprehensive list of provisioning parameters
   that are available on the PE-side of an AC is documented in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit].

   The required set of parameters is a function of the service offering.
   For example, a very limited set of parameters is required for mass-
   market service offering while a more elaborated set is required for
   Enterprise services (e.g., Layer 2 VPN [RFC9291] or Layer 3 VPN
   [RFC9182]).  This document *leverages access control, authorization,
   and authentication mechanisms that are already in place for the
   delivery of services over these ACs*.

1.2.  What's Out?

   This document does not make any assumption about the type of the
   network (fixed, cellular, etc.) that terminates an AC.

   Likewise, the document does not make any assumption about the
   services or applications that are delivered over an AC.  Whether one
   or multiple services are bound to the same AC is deployment specific.

   Applications will have access to all these NRLPs and will, thus,
   adjust their behavior as a function of scope and traffic category
   indicated in a policy (all traffic, streaming, etc.).  An application
   that couples multiple flow types will adjust each flow type to be
   consistent with the specific policy for the relevant traffic
   category.  Likewise, a host with multiple ACs may use the discovered
   NRLPs AC to decide how to distribute its flows over these ACs (prefer
   an AC to place an application session, migrate connection, etc.).
   That's said, this document does not make any recommendation about how
   a receiving host uses the discovered policy.

   Networks that advertize NLRPs are likely to maintain the policing in
   place within the network because of the trust model (hosts are not
   considered as trusted devices).  Per-subscriber rate-limit policies
   are generally recommended to protect nodes against Denial of Service
   (DoS) attacks (e.g., Section 9.3 of [RFC8803] or Section 8 of
   [I-D.ietf-masque-quic-proxy]).  Discussion about conditions under
   which such a trust model can be relaxed is out of scope of this
   document.

   This document does not assume nor preclude that other mechanisms,
   e.g., Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) [RFC9330],
   are enabled in a bottleneck link.  The reader may refer to Appendix A
   for a list of relevant mechanisms.  Whether these mechanism as
   alternative or complementary to explicit host/network signals is to
   be further assessed.

1.3.  Design Motivation & Rationale

   The main motivations for the use of ND for such a discovery are
   listed in Section 3 of [RFC8781]:

   *  Fate sharing

   *  Atomic configuration

   *  Updatability: change the policy at any time

   *  Deployability

   The solution specified in the document is designed to *ease
   integration with network management tools* that are used to manage
   and expose policies.  It does so by leveraging the policy structure
   defined in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit].  That same
   structure is also used in the context of service activation such as
   Network Slicing [RFC9543]; see the example depicted in Appendix B.5
   of [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang].

   The solution defined in this document:

   *  *Does not require any data plane change*.

   *  *Applicable to any transport protocol*.

   *  *Does not impact the connection setup delay*.

   *  *Does not require to reveal the identity of the target server or
      the application itself* to consume the signal.

   *  *Supports cascaded environments* where multiple levels to enforce
      rate-limiting polices is required (e.g., WAN and LAN shown in
      Figure 2).  NRLP signals can be coupled or decoupled as a function
      of the local policy.

   *  *Supports signaling policies bound to one or both traffic
      directions*.

   *  Is able to *signal whether a policy applies to a specific host or
      all hosts of a given subscriber*.

           '------' nrlp#3               |                    |
                                         '--------------------'

                    Figure 2: Example of Cascaded NRLPs

   Compared to a proxy or an encapsulation-based proposal (e.g.,
   [I-D.ihlar-masque-sconepro-mediabitrate]), the solution defined in
   this document:

   *  *Does not impact the MTU tweaking*: No packet overhead is
      required.

   *  *Does not suffer from side effects of multi-layer encryption
      schemes* on the packet processing and overall performance of
      involved network nodes.  Such issues are encountered, e.g., with
      the tunneled mode or long header packets in the forwarded QUIC
      proxy mode [I-D.ietf-masque-quic-proxy].

   *  *Does not suffer from nested congestion control* for tunneled
      proxy mode.

   *  *Does not incur multiple round-trips* in the forwarding mode for
      the client to start sending Short Header packets.

   *  *Does not incur the overhead of unauthenticated re-encryption of
      QUIC packets* in the scramble transform of the forwarding mode.

   *  *Does not impact the forwarding peformance of network nodes*. For
      example, the proxy forwarded mode [I-D.ietf-masque-quic-proxy]
      requires rewriting connection identifiers; that is, the
      performance degradation will be at least equivalent to NAT.

   *  *Does not suffer from the complications of IP address sharing
      [RFC6269]*. Such issues are likely to be experienced for proxy-
      based solutions that multiplex internal connections using one or
      more external IP addresses.

   *  *Does not suffer from penalizing the proxy* which could serve both
      good and bad clients (e.g., launching Layer 7 DDoS attacks).

   *  *Does not require manipulating extra steering policies on the
      host* to decide which flows can be forwarded over or outside the
      proxy connection.

   *  *Requires a minor change to the network*: For IPv6, upgrade PE
      nodes to support a new ND option.  Note that all IPv6 hosts and
      networks are required to support Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861].
      For IPv4, configure DHCP servers to include a new DHCP option.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Operational Considerations

3.1.  NRLP Is Complementary Not Replacement Solution

   Sharing NRLP signals are not intended to replace usual actions to
   soften bottlenck issues (e.g., adequate network dimensioning and
   upgrades).  However, given that such actions may not be always
   immediately possible or economically justified, NRLP signals can be
   considered as complementary mitigations to soften these issues by
   introducing some collaboration between a host and its networks to
   adjust their behaviors.

3.2.  Provisionning Policies

   NRLP senders should be configured with instructions about the type of
   network rate-limit policies to be shared with requesting hosts.
   These types can be provided using mechanisms such as
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit].

3.3.  Redundant vs. Useful Signal

   In contexts where the bitrate policies are known during the
   establishment of the underlying bearer (e.g., GBR PDU Sessions),
   sending NRLP signals over the AC may be redundant and should thus be
   disabled.

   In contexts where the (average) bitrate policies provided during the
   establishment of a bearer cannot be refreshed to echo network-
   specific conditions (e.g., overload) using bearer-specific
   mechanisms, sending NRLP signals over the AC would allow control the
   load at the source.

   When both bearer-specific policies and NRLP signals are communicated
   to a host, the NRLP signals takes precedence.

3.4.  Fairness

   Rate-limit policies enforced at the network are assumed to be
   consistent with the local jurisdictions.  For example:

   *  [BEREC] states that ISPs are prohibited from blocking or slowing
      down of Internet traffic, except for legal reasons, network
      security, or congestion, provided that equivalent categories of
      traffic are treated equally.

   *  [FCC] states that net neutrality policies "prohibits internet
      service providers from blocking, throttling, or engaging in paid
      prioritization of lawful content".  The FCC allows some
      exceptions, like for security and emergencies.

   These regulatory frameworks align with the goals of this document.

3.5.  Architectural Considerations Matter

   Approaches based on middleboxes are generally not recommended due to
   their inherent limitations, in terms of performance, scalability,
   redundancy, etc.  Specifically, if the management and operation of
   such middleboxes remain unclear, that motivate operational issues and
   responsibilities.  Furthermore, it is important to note that any
   middlebox could not necessarily cover an entire service end-to-end,
   thus *producing only partial observations which could not be
   sufficiently good at the time of generating appropriate signals*.

   The NRLP solution does not require such middleboxes but the
   consideration about partial observability applies.  That concern can
   be softened by cascaded NLRP design.  However, network integration of
   such appraoch is to be further elaborated.

3.6.  Service Considerations: Application Diversity & Realistic
      Assessment

   Signals could be generated for multiple services and/or applications.
   For instance, services providing short video content might require
   signals different to those based on long videos.  This implies the
   need of defining a generic method suitable for any kind of service
   and application, avoiding the multiplicity of solutions and the
   dominance of some applications over others.

   It should be also noted that more experimentation is needed in order
   to fully understand the implications of the signals in the overall
   performance of the network.  On one hand, the co-existence of
   multiple flows, some of them using the signals for improving the
   experience, some others not.  For this, more experimentation and
   datasets are required, so then can be clear that no flows are
   negatively impacted at all.

   On the other hand, if the experience of the flows improves and
   depending on the nature of the signals themselves, this might
   motivate a more intense usage of the network, then requiring to
   accommodate larger number of flows, and in consequence, reducing the
   available resources per application.  This kind of paradox can be
   *assessed with more experimental results under realistic conditions
   (i.e., multiple users and multiple services in the network)*.

3.7.  Operational Guidance for Signal Enforcement

   Signals are conceived as indications from the network towards
   applications.  It is not clear the way of enforcing the application
   to follow the indication, especially in a context where different
   applications from a user, or multiple users, simultaneously access
   the network.  This can motivate a wastage of resources for generating
   signals with the risk of not being effective.  Furthermore, it might
   lead to a continuous loop of signal generation because the initial
   signals being ignored.  It is then necessary to define mechanisms to
   avoid permanent signal generation when ignored.

   Finally, signals could not be required at every moment, but only in
   situations that can benefit the service.  Such situations could be
   due, for instance, to given levels of congestion, or based on
   previous information shared by the application (e.g., SLO thresholds)
   so that signals can be triggered according to service conditions.
   *Elaborating more operational guidance on intended signal enforcment
   policy is key*.

3.8.  Signal Estimation

   The validity of the estimation produced by a network might be
   questioned by the application.  Trust is required in a way that
   applications can safely follow guidance from a network.  Furthermore,
   whatever estimation should be timely produced, avoiding the
   generation of aged estimations that could not correspond to the
   actual service circumstances.  Finally, some common guidance is
   necessary to define a standard way of generating signals, for
   instance, per-flow or per group of flows.

   An open point is how to deal with adaptive applications, in the sense
   that signals could not be of value because the self-adaptation nature
   of these applications.

3.9.  Signal "Interference"

   The network is built on multiple layers.  In some cases, different
   solutions targeting similar objectives (e.g., congestion control or
   bottleneck mitigation) can be in place.  It is then necessary to
   *assess the simultaneous coexistence of these solutions to avoid
   contradictory effects or "interferences"*.

4.  Deployment Incentives

4.1.  Networks

   There are a set of tradeoffs for networks to deploy NRLP discovery:

   *  Cost vs. benefit

   *  Impact on operations vs incentive to deploy

   *  Enhanced experience vs. impacts on nominal mode

   The procedure defined in the document provides a mechanism to assist
   networks managing the load at the source and, thus, contribute to
   better handle network overloads and optimize the use of resources
   under non nominal conditions.  The mechanism also allows to enhance
   the quality of experience at the LAN by providing a simple tool to
   communicate local policies to hosts.  A minimal change is required to
   that aim.

   With the OS support, the following benefits might be considered by
   networks:

   Improved Network Performance:  The OS can schedule network requests
      more efficiently, preventing network congestion, and improving
      overall stability and network performance with NRLP signals.

   Cost Efficiency:  By managing network usage based on known rate
      limits, the OS can help reduce network-related costs.  However,
      this is difficult to assess.

   Networks that throttle bandwidth for reasons that are not compliant
   with local jurisdictions, not communicated to customers, etc. are
   unlikely to share NRLP signals.  If these signals are shared, it is
   unlikely that they will mirror the actual network configuration
   (e.g., application-specific policies).

4.2.  Applications

   Some applications support some forms of bandwidth measurements (e.g.,
   [app-measurement]) which feed how the content is accessed to using
   ABR.  Complementing or replacing these measurements with explicit
   signals depends upon:

   *  The extra cost that is required to support both mechanisms at the
      application layer.

   *  The complexity balance between performing the measurements vs.
      consuming the signal.

   *  Whether the measurements ("assessed property" per [RFC9473])
      reflect actual network conditions or severely diverge.

   *  The availability of the network signals at the first place: it is
      unlikely that all networks will support sending the signals.
      Deployment incentives at the network may vary.

   *  The host support may be variable.

   Applications that don't support (embedded) bandwidth measurement
   schemes will be enriched with the NRLP signals as this will be
   exposed by an OS API.

4.3.  Host OS

   API to facilitate Application Development:  An OS can provide more
      accurate available bandwidth to applications through the API (as
      mentioned in Section 4.2), making implementation easier for
      applications that don't requrie dedicated bandwidth measurement.

   Prevent Abuse:  The OS can allocate network resources more fairly
      among different processes, with NRLP signals, ensuring that no
      single process monopolizes the network.

   Better Resource Management:  OS can also optimize resource
      allocation, by deprioritizing background/inactive applications in
      the event of high network utilization.

   Enhanced Security:  Awareness of NRLPs can help the OS detect and
      mitigate network-related security threats, such as denial-of-
      service (DoS) attacks.

   Improved User Experience:  By avoiding network congestion and
      ensuring fair resource allocation, the OS can provide a smoother,
      more responsive user experience.

   Improved Application Development Efficiency:  OS providing rate
      limits through an API (as mentioned in Section 4.2) can provide
      the above listed benefits at per application level.

Appendix A.  Alternative/Complementary Mechanisms

   In the event of bottlenecks in a network, there are other mechanisms
   that provide information or help to reserve resources.  These can be
   used within the bottleneck network or, in some cases, across network
   boundaries.  The following sections give examples of such mechanisms
   and provide background information.

A.1.  L4S

   Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) is an
   architecture defined in [RFC9330] to avoid queuing at bottlenecks by
   capacity-seeking congestion controllers of senders.  L4S support
   addresses the investigated use case of this document, which considers
   rate limiting, which typically involves queuing discipline at the
   rate limiting bottleneck.  If all involved elements (UE, network, and
   service) support L4S, the use of Explicit Congestion Notification
   (ECN) provides the measure used to inform the network protocol and/or
   service endpoints in use of impending congestion.  Congestion
   detection and reaction may require a few RTTs to adjust to the
   network forwarding conditions.

   As of 3GPP Rel. 18 (5G Advanced, [TS-23.501]), L4S is also defined
   for the 5G system (5GS) and can be used by UE and its services, and
   for external parties of the 5GS by exposure of congestion
   information.

A.2.  Network Slicing

   One measure for guaranteeing resources in networks is network
   slicing.  This is achieved by configuring certain resources like
   adequate QoS setup for communication streams, which are taken into
   account in packet schedulers along the transport path. e.g., the RAN
   air interface.

   Network slicing is considered by 3GPP for 5G [TS-23.501] (an
   equivalent can be achieved in 4G by configuring QFI values), by IETF
   [RFC9543] for transport networks, and by BBF [TR-470] for wireline
   access.  A realization model in transport networks is detailed in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-5g-ns-ip-mpls].

   L4S Appendix A.1 can be used for the realization of a network slice.
   Network slices properties (e.g., throughput) can be retrieved from an
   operator network or configured by third parties via a network API
   Appendix A.4 (e.g., 3GPP NEF).

A.3.  3GPP UE Route Selection Policy

   UE Route Selection Policy (URSP) is a feature specified in 3GPP to
   match and forward traffic based upon a selection descriptor and a
   route descriptor as further detailed in [TS-23.503].

   Specified traffic descriptors may be:

   *  Application

   *  IP

   *  Domain

   *  Non-IP

   *  DNN

   *  Connection Capabilities

   *  Connectivity Group ID

   Specified route selection descriptors: must contain PDU Session Type
   Selection (e.g., IPv4v6 or IPv6) and may contain the following:

   *  SSC Mode

   *  Network Slice

   *  DNN

   *  Non-Seamless Offload indication

   *  Access Type preference

   URSP rules that contain both descriptors can be announced from the
   provider network to a UE or preconfigured in the UE, possibly
   subscription-based.  These rules can be used to identify services in
   the UE and to provide routes with explicit characteristics.  URSP
   rules might also be triggered by the usage of network APIs
   Appendix A.4 and combined with network slicing Appendix A.2, for
   example.

A.4.  Network APIs

   Network APIs are the interface between the operator network and
   third-party providers.  With 4G, the first methods were introduced to
   make network capabilities available, which has been greatly improved
   with the introduction of 5G.  To this end, the new Network Exposure
   Function (NEF) is responsible for 5G, which is specified in
   [TS-29.522], which defines a huge list of network capabilites for
   monitoring and configuration for external consumption.

   For integration into external services, initiatives such as the
   CAMARA Alliance and GSMA Open Gateway provide abstractions of these
   exposed network capabilities into service APIs for easy integration
   by developers.

   The CAMARA API "Network Slice Booking", which is currently under
   development, would be a way for a service provider to configure the
   necessary resources in the operator network.  In the background, 5G
   features such as network slicing Appendix A.2 , URSP Appendix A.3
   and, if necessary, L4S Appendix A.1 could then ensure implementation
   in the operator network.
