          "body": "Hi Jason,\r\n\r\n\"Attachment circuit\" is an established concept in IP/MPLS networks, you can see, for example, \r\n\r\n* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4026#section-6.1\r\n* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4364#section-3.1\r\n* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8049#section-3\r\n* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-opsawg-teas-common-ac/\r\n* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit/\r\n* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit/\r\n* etc.\r\n\r\nThe term \"circuit\" is also used in the transport layer, e.g., circuit breaker (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8084/)\r\n\r\nI agree that it is unfortunate that \"circuit\" was picked at the first place, but reusing this concept helps gluing various pieces that are already out there and also help generalizing the applicability. \r\n\r\nFor example, an AC can be UNI or NNI. Hence, s/ac/access network may not be adequate to mirror that scope as well.\r\n\r\nWhat about \"network attachment\"?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I also think it makes sense to discuss whether you need the details of information to go directly into RAs or DHCP, or if it makes sense to have this be in a separate service (like PvD, or like how CAPPORT had a separate server that you talk to to get the information).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTommy \r\n",

In that case, this could potentially be a signal that really doesn't need to identify the flow but just send to all the flows going through that device, be it a CPE or a shaper.\r\n\r\nGood observations, @sridharangirish91.\r\n\r\n> Might be worth including since it doesn't need to id specificities of the flow. But what are we signaling here? Queuing latency so that it can be added to cc rtt? Can't the router just set the ECN bit instead of signaling something so dynamic?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure this is actually in scope.

I suggest adding text to say the proposed mechanism also works for endpoint-specific signaling which would provide additional granularity (similar to the way MASQUE and QUIC based solutions). I propose the following text:\r\n\r\nTo enhance flexibility in applying rate-limiting policies and better accommodate diverse endpoint QoS requirements, mechanisms such as solicited Router Advertisements (RAs) [RFC 8273] and endpoint-specific DHCP responses can be employed. These unicast responses enable granular signaling of rate-limit policies to individual endpoints, facilitating differentiated rate-limit configurations. However, this draft does not prescribe how resources should be partitioned within local networks, as such considerations fall outside its scope.",

If all involved elements (UE, network, and service) support L4S, the use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) provides the measure used to inform the network protocol and/or service endpoints in use of impending congestion.
