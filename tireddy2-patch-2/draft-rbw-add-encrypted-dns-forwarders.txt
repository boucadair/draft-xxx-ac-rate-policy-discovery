                Hosting Encrypted DNS Forwarders on CPEs
             draft-rbw-add-encrypted-dns-forwarders-latest

Abstract

   Typical connectivity service offerings based upon on Customer Premise
   Equipment (CPEs) involve DNS forwarders on the CPE for various
   reasons (offer local services, control the scope/content of
   information in DNS, ensure better dependability for local service,
   provide control to users, etc.).  Upgrading DNS to use encrypted
   transports introduces deployment complications as to how to sustain
   current offerings with local services.  Solutions are needed to ease
   operating DNS forwarders in CPEs while allowing to make use of
   encrypted DNS capabilities.

   This document describes the problem and why some existing solutions
   can't be used for these deployments.  For example, Star certificates
   and name constraints extension suffer from the problem of deploying a
   new feature to CAs, TLS clients, and servers.

   The scope of this document is encrypted DNS servers deployed on
   managed CPEs.

1.  Introduction

   Customer Premises Equipment (CPEs, also called Home Routers) are a
   critical component of the home network, and their security is
   essential to protecting the devices and data that are connected to
   them.  For example, the prpl Foundation [prpl] has developed a number
   of initiatives to promote home router security and hardening.  The
   prplWrt project [prplwrt] is an initiative in prpl Foundation that
   aims to improve the security and performance of open-source router
   firmware, such as OpenWrt [openwrt].  OpenWrt is an open-source
   operating system that is designed to run on a wide range of routers
   and embedded devices.  It now includes support for containerization
   technology such as Docker, making it possible to run containerized
   applications on a home router.  Further, DNS providers have optimized
   the encrypted DNS forwarder to run in a container in home routers.

   However, upgrading DNS to use encrypted transports (e.g., DNS over
   HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484], DNS over TLS (DoT) [RFC7858], and DNS over
   QUIC (DoQ) [RFC9250]) introduces deployment complications as to how
   to sustain current offerings with local services.

   This document describes the problem encountered to host encrypted DNS
   resolvers in managed CPEs.  It also discusses limitations of existing
   solutions.

   The document does not focus on generic considerations related to
   deploying DNS proxies.  The reader may refer to [RFC5625] for such
   matters.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

               Figure 1: Proxied Encrypted DNS Sessions

   For all the cases shown in Figure 1, the CPE advertises itself as the
   default DNS server to the hosts it serves in the LAN.  The CPE relies
   upon DHCP or RA to advertise itself to internal hosts as the default
   encrypted DNS forwarder using DNR.  When receiving a DNS request that
   a CPE cannot handle locally, the CPE forwards the request to an
   upstream encrypted DNS.  The upstream encrypted DNS can be hosted by
   the ISP or provided by a third party.

   Such a forwarder presence is required for (but not limuted to):

   *  IPv4 service continuity purposes (e.g., Section 3.1 of [RFC8585]).

   *  Supporting advanced services within a local network such as:

      -  malware filtering,

      -  parental control,

      -  Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) [RFC8520] to only allow
         intended communications to and from an IoT device, and

      -  offer multicast DNS proxy service for the ".local" domain
         [RFC6762].

   When the CPE behaves as a DNS forwarder, DNS communications can be
   decomposed into two legs to resolve queries:

   *  The leg between an internal host and the CPE.

   *  The leg between the CPE and an upstream DNS resolver.

4.  Hosting Encrypted DNS Forwarder in Local Networks

   This section discusses some deployment challenges to host an
   encrypted DNS forwarder within a local network.

4.1.  Discovery Mechanisms and Naming Constraints

4.1.1.  Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR)

   DDR requires proving possession of an IP address, as the DDR
   certificate contains the server's IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and is
   signed by a certificate authority.  DDR is constrained to public IP
   addresses because (WebPKI) certificate authorities will not sign
   special-purpose IP addresses [RFC6890], most notably IPv4 private-use
   [RFC1918], IPv4 shared address [RFC6598], or IPv6 Unique-Local
   [RFC8190] address space.

   A tempting solution for enabling an encrypted DNS forwarder with DDR
   is to use the CPE's WAN IP address for DDR and prove possession of
   that IP address.  However, the CPE's WAN IPv4 address will not be a
   public IPv4 address if the CPE is behind another layer of NAT (either
   Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) or another on-premise NAT), reducing the
   success of this mechanism to CPE's WAN IPv6 address.

   Also, if the ISP renumbers the subscriber's network suddenly (rather
   than slow IPv6 renumbering described in [RFC4192]), encrypted DNS
   service will be delayed until that new certificate is acquired.

4.1.2.  Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR)

   DNR requires proving possession of a domain name as the encrypted
   resolver's certificate contains the FQDN.  For example, the entity
   (e.g., ISP or network administrator) managing the CPE would assign a
   unique FQDN to the CPE.  There are two mechanisms for the CPE to
   obtain the certificate for the FQDN: using one of its WAN IP
   addresses or requesting its signed certificate from an Internet-
   facing server used for remote CPE management (e.g., the Auto
   Configuration Server (ACS) in the CPE WAN Management Protocol
   [TR-069]).

   If the CPE's WAN IP address is used, the CPE needs a public IPv4 or a
   global unicast IPv6 address together with DNS A or AAAA records
   pointing to that CPE's WAN address to prove possession of the DNS
   name to obtain a (WebPKI) CA-signed certificate.  That is, the CPE
   fulfills the DNS or HTTP challenge discussed in Automatic Certificate
   Management Environment (ACME) [RFC8555].  However, a CPE's WAN
   address will not be a public IPv4 address if the CPE is behind
   another layer of NAT (either a CGN or another on-premise NAT),
   reducing the success of this mechanism to a CPE's WAN IPv6 address.
   If the ISP renumbers the subscriber's network, the DNS record will
   also need to expire and changed to reflect the new IP address.

5.  Limitations of Existing Solutions

5.1.  Certificate Issuance Issues

   The following lists some limitations for certificate issuance:

   *  In case of large scale of CPEs (e.g., millions of devices),
      issuing certificate request for a large number of subdomains could
      be treated as an attack by the certificate authorities to
      overwhelm it.

   *  Dependency on the CA to issue a large number of certificates.

   *  If the CPE uses one of its WAN IP addresses to obtain the
      certificate for the FQDN, the Internet-facing HTTP server or a DNS
      authoritative server on the CPE to complete the HTTP or DNS
      challenge can be subjected to DDoS attacks.

5.2.  Delegated Certificate Issuance

   Let's consider that the encrypted DNS forwarder is hosted on a CPE
   and provisioned by a service (e.g., ACS) in the operator's network.
   Also, let's assume that each CPE is assigned a unique FQDN (e.g.,
   "cpe-12345.example.com" where 12345 is a unique number).

      It is best to ensure that such an FQDN does not carry any
      Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or device identification
      details like the customer number or device's serial number.

   The CPE generates a public and private key-pair, builds a certificate
   signing request (CSR), and sends the CSR to a service in the operator
   managing the CPE.  Upon receipt of the CSR, the operator's service
   can utilize certificate management protocols like ACME [RFC8555] to
   automate certificate management functions such as domain validation
   procedure, certificate issuance, and certificate revocation.

   The challenge with this technique is that the service will have to
   communicate with the CA to issue certificates for millions of CPEs.
   If an external CA is unable to issue a certificate in time or replace
   an expired certificate, the service would no longer be able to
   present a valid certificate to a CPE.  When the service requests
   certificate issuance for a large number of subdomains (e.g., millions
   of CPEs), it may be treated as an attacker by the CA to overwhelm it.
   Furthermore, the short-lived certificates (e.g., certificates that
   expire after 90 days) issued by the CA will have to be renewed
   frequently.  With short-lived certificates, there is a smaller time
   window to renew a certificate and, therefore, a higher risk that a CA
   outage will negatively affect the uptime of the encrypted DNS
   forwarders on CPEs (and the services offered via these CPEs).

   These challenges can be addressed by using protocols like ACME to
   automate the certificate renewal process, ensuring certificates are
   renewed well before expiration.  Additionally, incorporating another
   CA as a backup can provide redundancy and further mitigate the risk
   of outages.  By having a secondary CA, the service can switch to the
   backup CA in case the primary CA is unavailable, thus maintaining
   continuous service availability and reducing the risk of service
   disruption.

   It offers the additional advantage of improving the security of
   Browser and CPE interactions.  This ensures that HTTPS access to the
   CPE is possible, allowing the device administrator to securely
   communicate with and manage the CPE.

5.3.  Limitations of Name Constraints Extension

   A service managing the CPEs could get a CA certificate with name
   constraints extension (Section 4.2.1.10 of [RFC5280]) and the service
   would in-turn act as an ACME server to provision end-entity
   certificates on CPEs.

   *  Con:

      -  Name constraints extension is not yet supported by CAs,
         although [RFC5280] was standardized way back in 2008.

   *  Pro:

      -  Avoids changing TLS client and server (e.g., stunnel or
         openssl).

5.4.  Limitations of Star certificates

   [RFC9115] defines a profile of the ACME protocol for generating
   Delegated certificates.  It allows the CPEs to request from a service
   managing the CPEs, acting as a profiled ACME server, a certificate
   for a delegated identity, i.e., one belonging to the service.  The
   service then uses the ACME protocol (with the extensions described in
   [RFC8739]) to request issuance of a short-term, Automatically Renewed
   (STAR) certificate for the same delegated identity.  The generated
   short-term certificate is automatically renewed by the ACME CA,
   periodically fetched by the CPEs, and used to act as encrypted DNS
   forwarders.

   The service can end the delegation at any time by instructing the CA
   to stop the automatic renewal and letting the certificate expire
   shortly thereafter.  Star certificates requires support by CAs but
   does not require changes to the deployed TLS ecosystem.

   *  Cons:

      -  Star certificates require support by CAs.

      -  A primary use case of Star certificates is that of a Content
         Delivery Network (CDN), the third party, terminating TLS
         sessions on behalf of a content provider (the holder of a
         domain name).  The number of star certificates required for a
         CDN use case will be very much lower than the use case
         discussed in this draft.  It is yet to be seen if CAs will
         agree to support star certificates at a scale of millions of
         CPEs.

   *  Pro:

      -  Avoids changing TLS client and server.

6.  Security Considerations

   DNR-related security considerations are discussed in Section 7 of
   [RFC9463].  Likewise, DDR-related security considerations are
   discussed in Section 7 of [RFC9462].

   The communication between the CPE and endpoints is encrypted using
   WPA2/3, and any communication with the DNS server co-located on the
   CPE is also protected.  However, the client does not know whether the
   DNS server is co-located on the CPE or not.  If the client uses clear
   text DNS, it will assume the DNS messages are susceptible to
   pervasive monitoring.  For instance, in an Enterprise deployment,
   multiple network devices could exist between the endpoint and the
   CPE, and hosting an encrypted DNS server on the CPE minimizes the
   impact of a breach, which is an essential zero trust principle.
   Furthermore, the client and user would be able to identify the entity
   hosting the encrypted DNS server using the ADN assigned to it.

7.  IANA Considerations
