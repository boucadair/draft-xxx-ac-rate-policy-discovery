                   Throughput Advice Object for SCONE
             draft-brw-scone-throughput-advice-blob-latest

Abstract

   Traffic exchanged over a network may be subject to rate-limit
   policies for various operational reasons.  This document specifies a
   generic object (called, Throughput Advice) that can be used by
   mechanisms for hosts to dynamically discover these network rate-limit
   policies.  This information is then passed to applications that might
   adjust their behaviors accordingly.

   The design of the throughput advice object is independent of the
   discovery channel (protocol, API, etc.).

1.  Introduction

   Connectivity services are provided by networks to customers via
   dedicated terminating points, such as customer edges (CEs) or User
   Equipment (UE).  To facilitate data transfer via the provider
   network, it is assumed that appropriate setup is provisioned over the
   links that connect customer terminating points and a provider network
   (usually via a Provider Edge (PE)), successfully allowing data
   exchange over these links.  The required setup is referred to in this
   document as network attachments, while the underlying link is
   referred to as "bearers".

   The bearer can be a physical or logical link that connects a customer
   device to a provider network.  A bearer can be a wireless or wired
   link.  The same or multiple bearer technologies can be used to
   establish the bearer (e.g., WLAN or cellular) to graft customer
   terminating points to a network.

   Figure 1 shows an example of a network that connects CEs and hosts
   (UE, for example).  These CEs are servicing other (internal) hosts.
   The identification of these hosts is hidden from the network.  The
   policies enforced at the network for a network attachment are per-
   subscriber, not per-host.  Typically, if a CE is provided with a /56
   IPv6 prefix, policies are enforced in the network on that /56 not the
   individual /64s that will be used by internal hosts.  A customer
   terminating point may be serviced with one (e.g., UE#1, CE#1, and
   CE#3) or multiple network attachments (e.g., CE#2).  For the sake of
   simplicity, Figure 1 does not show the interconnection with other
   networks or multi-homed CEs.

                    Figure 1: Sample Network Attachments

   Customer terminating points are provided with a set of information
   (e.g., IP address/prefix) to successfully be able to send and receive
   traffic over a network attachment.  The required set of parameters to
   provision a network attachment is a function of the connectivity
   service offering.  For example, a very limited set of parameters is
   required for mass-market service offering while a more elaborated set
   is required for Enterprise services.  A comprehensive list of
   provisioning parameters that are available on the PE-side of a
   network attachment is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit].

   As discussed, e.g., in Section 4.2 of [RFC7567], packet dropping by
   network devices occurs mainly to protect the network (e.g.,
   congestion-unresponsive flows) and also to ensure fairness over a
   shared link.  These policies may be intentional policies (e.g.,
   enforced as part of the activation of the network attachment and
   typically agreed upon service subscription) or be reactive policies
   (e.g., enforced temporarily to manage an overload or during a DDoS
   attack mitigation).  Rate-limits are usually configured in (ingress)
   nodes.  These rate-limits can be shared with customers when
   subscribing to a connectivity service (e.g., "A YANG Data Model for
   Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (L2VPN) Service Delivery" [RFC8466]).

   Section 5 defines a set of parameters that can be used by networks to
   share the rate-limit policies applied on a network attachment:
   Throughput Advice.  The set of parameters are independent of the
   address family.

   This document does not assume nor preclude any specific signaling
   protocol to share the throughput advices.  These parameters are
   independent of the channel that is used by hosts to discover such
   policies.

   Whether host-to-network, network-to-host, or both policies are
   included in throughput advice is deployment specific.  All these
   combinations are supported in this document.

   Also, one or more throughput advice instances may be returned for a
   given traffic direction.  Examples of such instances are discussed in
   Section 6.

   As one can infer from the name, a throughput advice is advisory in
   nature.  The advice is provided solely as a hint.

   In order to ease mapping with specific signaling mechanisms, allow
   for future extensions, and ensure consistent use of the advice, a new
   IANA registry is created in Section 8.

2.  What's Out?

   This document does not make any assumption about:

   *  The type of network (fixed, cellular, etc.) that terminates a
      network attachment.

   *  The services or applications that are delivered over a network
      attachment.  Whether one or multiple services are bound to the
      same network attachment is deployment specific.

   *  How the throughput advice is computed/set.

   *  The protocol machinery for validating, refreshing, detecting
      stale, and flushing out received advices.

   *  How applications running over a host can learn the bitrates
      associated with a network attachment.  Typically, this can be
      achieved by invoking a dedicated API.  However, the exact details
      of the API(s) is OS-specific and, thus, out of scope of this
      document.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the following term:

   Rate-limit:  Used as a generic term to refer to a policy to restrict
      the maximum bitrate over a network attachment.

      It can be used with or without any traffic classification.

      A rate-limit can involve limiting the rate and/or burst size.

4.  Sample Deployment Cases

   Some deployment use cases for throughput advice discovery are
   provided below:

   Adaptive Application Behavior:  Discovery of intentional policy
      applied on network attachments when such information is not made
      available during the service activation or when network upgrades
      are performed.  Adaptive applications will use the information to
      adjust their behavior.

      Concretely, applications are supposed to have access to all
      throughput advice instances and would, thus, adjust their behavior
      as a function of the parameters indicated in a throughput policy.

      Likewise, a host with multiple network attachments may use the
      discovered throughput advice instances over each network
      attachment to decide how to distribute its flows over these
      network attachments (prefer a network attachment to place an
      application session, migrate connection, etc.).  That's said, this
      document does not make any recommendation about how a receiving
      host uses the discovered policy.

      The throughput advice can feed mechanisms such as Section 4.4.2 of
      [RFC7661] or Section 7.8 of [RFC9002] to control the maximum burst
      size.

   Network Assisted Offload:  A network may advertize a throughput
      advice when it is overloaded, including when it is under attack.
      The rate-limit policy is basically a reactive policy that is meant
      to adjust the behavior of connected hosts to better control the
      load during these exceptional events (issue with RAN resources,
      for example).

      The mechanism can also be used to enrich the tools that are
      already available to better handle attack traffic close to the
      source [RFC9066].

   Better Local Services:  A user may configure policies on the CE such
      as securing some resources to a specific internal host used, e.g.,
      for gaming or video streaming.  The CE can use the throughput
      advice to share these rate-limit policies to connected hosts to
      adjust their forwarding behavior.  Controlling the load at the
      source will allow to partition the resources between connected
      hosts.

5.  Throughput Advice Object

5.1.  Throughput Parameters

   The throughput advice parameters leverage existing technologies for
   configuring policies in provider networks.  Appendix A provides a
   brief overview of how inbound policies are enforced in ingress
   network nodes.  The reader may refer to [RFC2697], [RFC2698], and
   [RFC4115] for examples of how various combinations of Committed
   Information Rate (CIR), Committed Burst Size (CBS), Excess
   Information Rate (EIR), Excess Burst Size (EBS), Peak Information
   Rate (PIR), and Peak Burst Size (PBS) are used for policing.
   Typically:

   *  A Single-Rate, Two-Color Marker (1r2c) uses CIR and CBS.

   *  A Single-Rate, Three-Color Marker (1r3c) [RFC2697] uses CIR, CBS,
      and EBS.

   *  A Dual-Rate, Three-Color Marker (2r3c) [RFC2698] uses CIR, CBS,
      PIR, and PBS.

   *  2r3c when implemented with [RFC4115] uses CIR, CBS, EIR, and EBS.
      This mode allows for a better handling of in-profile traffic
      (refer to Section 1 of [RFC4115] for more details).

   An implementation example of these variants (and others) can be found
   at [VPP].

   This version of the document uses the common denominator of all these
   policies: CIR/CBS.

5.2.  Overall Object Structure

   A throughput advice object may include multiple throughput advices
   (referred to as "throughput advice instances"), each covering a
   specific match criteria.  Each of these instances adheres to the
   structure defined in Section 5.3.

   Throughput advice objects are bound to the network interface over
   which the advice was received.

   The throughput advice object is described in CDDL [RFC8610] format
   shown in Figure 2.  This format is meant to ease mapping with
   encoding specifics of a given discovery channel that supplies the
   throughput advice.

   ; Provides information about the rate-limit policy that is
   ; enforced for a network attachment.
   ; One or more throughput instances can be present in an advice.

   throughput-advice =  [+ throughput-instance]

   throughput-instance =  {
     ? instance-flags => flags,
     ? traffic-category => category,
     throughput => rate-limit
   }

   ; Indicates scope, traffic direction, and reliability type.
   ; Default value for scope is per subscriber policy.
   ; Default value for direction is network-to-host direction.
   ; Default value for reliability is false (i.e., the policy is
   ; applicable to both reliable and unreliable traffic).
   ; If any of these parameters is not present, this is equivalent
   ; to enclosing the parameter with its default value.

   flags =  {
     ? scope: &scope-values .default subscriber,
     ? direction: &direction-values .default n2h,
     ? reliability: &reliability-values .default any
   }

   scope-values = (subscriber: 0, host: 1, flow: 2)
   direction-values = (n2h: 0, h2n: 1, bidir: 2)
   reliability-values = (any: 0, reliable: 1, unreliable: 2)

   ; Indicates traffic category to which the policy is bound.
   ; If the value is set to 0, this means that the policy is
   ; enforced for all traffic.

   category =  {
     ? tc: uint .default 0
   }

   ; Indicates the rate and burst limits.
   ; Only CIR/CBS are mandatory to include.

   rate-limit = {
     cir: uint,          ; Mbps
     cbs: uint .gt 0,    ; bytes
   }

             Figure 2: Throughput Advice Object Format in CDDL

5.3.  Throughput Advice Instance Attributes

   This section defines the set of attributes that are included in a
   throughput advice instance:

   Instance Flags (IF):  These flags are used to express some generic
      properties of the applicability of the instance.  The following
      flags are defined:

      S (Scope):  Indicates the granularity of enforcing policies.

         This parameter specifies whether the policy is a per-
         subscriber, per-host, or per-flow policy.

      D (Direction):  Indicates the direction on which to apply the
         enclosed policy.

         When set to "00b", this flag indicates that this policy is for
         network-to-host direction.

         When set to "01b", this flag indicates that this policy is for
         host-to-network direction.

         When set to "10b", this flag indicates that this policy is for
         both network-to-host and host-to-network directions.

      R (Reliability):  Indicates the reliability type of traffic on
         which to apply the enclosed policy.

         For example, reliable could map to Queue-Building (QB) and
         unreliable could map to Non-Queue-Building (NQB).  One of the
         ways for application to make reliability markings visible is by
         following, e.g., the considerations in Section 4 of
         [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-nqb].

         When set to "00b", this flag indicates that this policy is for
         both reliable and unreliable traffic.

         When set to "01b", this flag indicates that this policy is for
         unreliable traffic.

         When set to "10b", this flag indicates that this policy is for
         reliable traffic.

         No meaning is associated with setting the field to "11b".  Such
         value MUST be silently ignored by the receiver.

      U:  Unassigned flags.  See Section 8.2.

   TC (Traffic Category):  Specifies a traffic category to which this
      policy applies.

      The following values are supported:

      *  "0": All traffic.  This is the default value.

      *  1-63: Unassigned values.  See Section 8.3.

   Committed Information Rate (CIR) (Mbps):  An average rate that
      specifies the maximum number of bits that a network can send (or
      receive) during one second over a network attachment.

      The CIR value MUST be greater than or equal to 0.

      If set to 0 (or a very low value), this indicates to the host that
      alternate paths (if any) should be preferred over this one.

      This parameter is mandatory.

   Committed Burst Size (CBS) (bytes):  Specifies the maximum burst size
      that can be transmitted at CIR.

      MUST be greater than zero.

      This parameter is mandatory.

6.  Examples

   For the sake of illustration, Figure 3 exemplifies the content of a
   throughput advice using JSON notations.  The advice includes one
   rate-limit instance that covers network-to-host traffic direction and
   is applicable to all traffic destined to any host of a subscriber.

   {
       "throughput-advice": [
           {
               "direction": 0,
               "scope": 0,
               "tc": 0,
               "cir": 50,
               "cbs": 10000
           }
       ]
   }

                          Figure 3: A JSON Example

   The advice conveyed in Figure 4 is similar to the advice in Figure 3.
   The only difference is that default values are not explicitly
   signaled in Figure 4.

   {
       "throughput-advice": [
           {
               "cir": 50,
               "cbs": 10000
           }
       ]
   }

    Figure 4: A JSON Example with Default Values Not Explicitly Signaled

   Figure 5 shows the example of an advice that encloses two instances,
   each for one traffic direction.

   {
       "throughput-advice": [
           {
               "direction": 0,
               "cir": 50,
               "cbs": 10000
           },
           {
               "direction": 1,
               "cir": 30,
               "cbs": 8000
           }
       ]
   }

           Figure 5: A JSON Example with Both Traffic Directions

   If both directions are covered by the same rate-limit policy, then
   the advice can be supplied as shown in Figure 6

   {
       "throughput-advice": [
           {
               "direction": 2,
               "cir": 50,
               "cbs": 10000
           }
       ]
   }

        Figure 6: A JSON Example with Single Bidir Rate-Limit Policy

7.  Security Considerations

   As discussed in Section 4, sharing a throughput advice helps networks
   mitigate overloads, particularly during periods of high traffic
   volume.

   An attacker who has the ability to change the throughput advice
   objects exchanged over a network attachment may:

   Decrease the bitrate value:  This may lower the perceived QoS if the
      host aggressively lowers its transmission rate.

   Increase the bitrate value:  The network attachment will be
      overloaded, but still the rate-limit at the network will discard
      excess traffic.

   Delete or remove the advice:  This is equivalent to deployments where
      the advice is not shared.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Rate-Limit Policy Objects Registry Group

   This document requests IANA to create a new registry group entitled
   "SCONE Rate-Limit Policy Objects".

8.2.  Instance Flags Registry

   This document requests IANA to create a new registry entitled
   "Instance flags" under the "SCONE Rate-Limit Policy Objects" registry
   group (Section 8.1).

   The initial values of this registry is provided in Table 1.

          +==============+=======+=============+===============+
          | Bit Position | Label | Description | Reference     |
          +==============+=======+=============+===============+

Appendix A.  Overview of Network Rate-Limit Policies

   As discussed, for example in [I-D.ietf-teas-5g-ns-ip-mpls], a
   provider network's inbound policy can be implemented using one of
   following options:

   *  1r2c (single-rate two-color) rate limiter

      This is the most basic rate limiter, described in Section 2.3 of
      [RFC2475].  It meters at an ingress interface a traffic stream and
      marks its packets as in-profile (below CIR being enforced) or out-
      of-profile (above CIR being enforced).  In-profile packets are
      accepted and forwarded.  Out-of profile packets are either dropped
      right at the ingress node (hard rate limiting), or remarked (with
      different MPLS TC or DSCP TN markings) to signify 'this packet
      should be dropped in the first place, if there is a congestion'
      (soft rate limiting), depending on the business policy of the
      provider network.  In the second case, while packets above CIR are
      forwarded at an ingress node, they are subject to being dropped
      during any congestion event at any place in the provider network.

   *  2r3c (two-rate three-color) rate limiter

      This was initially defined in [RFC2698], and its improved version
      in [RFC4115].  The traffic is assigned to one of the these three
      categories:

      -  Green, for traffic under CIR

      -  Yellow, for traffic between CIR and PIR

      -  Red, for traffic above PIR

      An inbound 2r3c meter implemented with [RFC4115], compared to
      [RFC2698], is more 'customer friendly' as it doesn't impose
      outbound peak-rate shaping requirements on customer edge (CE)
      devices or hosts. 2r3c meters in general give greater flexibility
      for provider network edge enforcement regarding accepting the
      traffic (green), de-prioritizing and potentially dropping the
      traffic on transit during congestion (yellow), or hard dropping
      the traffic (red).
