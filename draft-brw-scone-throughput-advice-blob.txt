                   Throughput Advice Object for SCONE
             draft-brw-scone-throughput-advice-blob-latest

Abstract

   Traffic exchanged over a network may be subject to rate-limit
   policies.  These policies may be intentional policies (e.g., enforced
   as part of the activation of the network attachment and typically
   agreed upon service subscription) or be reactive policies (e.g.,
   enforced temporarily to manage an overload or during a DDoS attack
   mitigation).

   This document specifies a generic object that can be be used by
   mechanims for hosts to dynamically discover network rate-limit
   policies.  This information is then passed to applications that might
   adjust their behaviors accordingly.  The design of the object is
   independent of the discovery channel.

1.  Introduction

   Connectivity services are provided by networks to customers via
   dedicated terminating points, such as customer edges (CEs) or User
   Equipment (UE).  To facilitate data transfer via the provider
   network, it is assumed that appropriate setup is provisioned over the
   links that connect customer terminating points and a provider network
   (usually via a Provider Edge (PE)), successfully allowing data
   exchange over these links.  The required setup is referred to in this
   document as network attachments, while the underlying link is
   referred to as "bearers".

   The bearer can be a physical or logical link that connects a customer
   device to a provider network.  A bearer can be a wireless or wired
   link.  The same or multiple bearer technologies can be used to
   establish the bearer (e.g., WLAN, cellular) to graft customer
   terminating points to a network.

      Network attachment is also known as "Attachment Circuit (AC)"
      which is an established concept in the industry and also in the
      IETF ([RFC4026], [RFC4664], [RFC4364], etc.).

   Figure 1 shows an example of a network that connects CEs and hosts
   (UE, for example).  These CEs are servicing other (internal) hosts.
   The identification of these hosts is hidden from the network.  The
   policies enforced at the network for a network attachment are per-
   subscriber, not per-host.  Typically, if a CE is provided with a /56
   IPv6 prefix, policies are enforced on that /56 not the individual
   /64s that will be used by internal hosts.  A customer terminating
   point may be serviced with one (e.g., UE#1, CE#1, and CE#3) or
   multiple network attachments (e.g., CE#2).

      Figure 1 does not show the interconnection with other networks for
      the sake of simplicity.

                    Figure 1: Sample Network Attachments

   Customer terminating points are provided with a set of information
   (e.g., IP address/prefix) to successfully be able to send and receive
   traffic over a network attachment.  A comprehensive list of
   provisioning parameters that are available on the PE-side of a
   network attachment is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit].

   The required set of parameters to provision a network attachment is a
   function of the service offering.  For example, a very limited set of
   parameters is required for mass-market service offering while a more
   elaborated set is required for Enterprise services.

   As discussed, e.g., in Section 4.2 of [RFC7567], packet dropping by
   network devices occurs mainly to protect the network (e.g.,
   congestion-unresponsive flows) and also to ensure fairness over a
   shared link.  Rate-limits are usually configured in (ingress) nodes.
   These rate-limits can be shared with customers when subscribing to a
   connectivity service (e.g., "A YANG Data Model for Layer 2 Virtual
   Private Network (L2VPN) Service Deliver" [RFC8466]).

   Section 5 defines a set parameters that can be used by networks to
   share the rate-limit policies applied on a network attachment:
   Throuput Advice.  The set of parameters are independent of the
   address family.

   This document does not assume nor preclude any specific signaling
   protocol to share the throuput advices.  These parameters are
   independent of the channel that is used by hosts to discover such
   policies.

   Whether host-to-network, network-to-host, or both policies are
   returned in a throuput advice is deployment specific.  All these
   combinations are supported in this document.

   Also, one more throuput advice instances may be returned for a given
   traffic direction.  Each of these instances may cover a specific
   traffic category.

   The document leverages existing technologies for configuring policies
   in provider networks.  Appendix A provides a brief overview of how
   inbound policies are enforced in ingress network nodes.  The reader
   may refer to [RFC2697], [RFC2698], and [RFC4115] for examples of how
   various combinations of Committed Information Rate (EIR), Committed
   Burst Size (CBS), Excess Information Rate (EIR), Excess Burst Size
   (EBS), Peak Information Rate (PIR), and Peak Burst Size (PBS) are
   used for policing.  Typically:

   *  A Single-Rate, Three-Color Marker [RFC2697] uses CIR, CBS, and
      EBS.

   *  A Dual-Rate, Three-Color Marker [RFC2698] uses CIR, CBS, PIR, and
      PBS.  Note that when implemented with [RFC4115], it allows for a
      better handling of in-profile traffic (refer to Section 1 of
      [RFC4115] for more details).

   In order to ease mapping with specific signaling mechanims, allow for
   future extensions, and ensure consistent use of the advice, a new
   IANA registry is created in Section 9.

2.  What's Out?

   This document does not make any assumption about:

   *  The type of the network (fixed, cellular, etc.) that terminates a
      network attachment.

   *  The services or applications that are delivered over a network
      attachment.  Whether one or multiple services are bound to the
      same network attachment is deployment specific.

   *  How the throughput advice is computed/set.

   *  How applications running over a host can learn the bitrates
      associated with a network attachment.  Typically, this can be
      achieved by invoking a dedicated API.  However, the exact details
      of the API is OS-specific and, thus, out of scope of this
      document.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use fo the following term:

   Rate-limit:  Used as a generic term to refer to a policy to restrict
      the maximum bitrate of a flow.

      It can be used with or without any traffic classification.

      A rate-limit can involve limiting the rate and/or burst size.

4.  Sample Deployment Cases

   Some deployment use cases for throuput advice discovery are provided
   below:

   Adaptive Application Behavior:  Discovery of intentional policy
      applied on network attachements (CE-PE links, peering links, etc.)
      when such information is not made available during the service
      activation or when network upgrades are performed.  Adaptive
      applications will thus used the information to adjust their
      behavior.

      Concretely, applications are supposed to have access to all
      throuput advice instances and would, thus, adjust their behavior
      as a function of scope and traffic category indicated in a
      throughput policy (all traffic, streaming, etc.).  An application
      that couples multiple flow types would adjust each flow type to be
      consistent with the specific policy for the relevant traffic
      category.

      Likewise, a host with multiple network attachments may use the
      discovered throuput advice instances over each network attachment
      to decide how to distribute its flows over these network
      attachments (prefer a network attachment to place an application
      session, migrate connection, etc.).  That's said, this document
      does not make any recommendation about how a receiving host uses
      the discovered policy.

   Network Assisted Offload:  A network may advertize a throuput advice
      when it is overloaded, including when it is under attack.  The
      rate-limit policy is basically a reactive policy that is meant to
      adjust the behavior of connected hosts to better control the load
      during these exceptional events (issue with RAN resources, for
      example).  The mechanism can also be used to enrich the tools that
      are already available to better handle attack traffic close to the
      source [RFC9066].

   Better Local Services:  A user may configure policies on the CPE such
      as securing some resources to a specific internal host used for
      gaming or video streaming.  The CPE can use the throuput advice to
      share these rate-limit policies to connected hosts to adjust their
      forwarding behavior.

5.  Throughput Advice Object

5.1.  Overall Object Structure

   A throuput advice object may include multiple throughput advices
   (referred to as "throughput advice instances"), each covering a
   specific match criteria.  Each of these adhere to the structure
   defined in Section 5.2.

   The throughput advice object is described in CDDL [RFC8610] format
   shown in Figure 2.  This format is meant to ease mapping with
   encoding specifics of a given discovery channel that supplies the
   throughput advice.

   ; Provides information about the rate-limit policy that is
   ; enforced for a network attachment.
   ; One or more throughput instances can be present in an advice.

   throughput-advice =  [+ throughput-instance]

   throughput-instance =  {
     ? optional-parameter-flags => opf,
     ? flow-flags => ff,
     ? traffic-category => category,
     throughput => rate-limit
   }

   ; opf controls the presence of optional parameters such as
   ; excess and peak rates.
   ; Settting these parameters to false means that excess and
   ; peak parameters are not supplied in the policy.
   ; These control bits may not be required for protocols
   ; with built-in mechanisms to parse objects even with
   ; optional/variable fields.

   opf =  {
     ? excess: bool .default false,
     ? peak: bool .default false
   }

   ; ff indicates scope (per host or per subscriber), traffic
   ; direction, and reliability type (reliable or unreliable).
   ; Default value for scope is false (i.e., per subscriber policy).
   ; Default value for direction is 0 (i.e. network-to-host direction).
   ; Default value for reliability is false (i.e., the policy is
   ; applicable to both reliable and unreliable traffic).
   ; If any of these parameters is not present, this is equivalent
   ; to enclosing the parameter with its default value.

   ff =  {
     ? scope: bool .default false,
     ? direction: uint .default 0,
     ? reliability: uint .default false
   }

   ; category indicates traffic category to which the policy is bound.
   ; If the value is set to 0, this means that the policy is
   ; enforced for all traffic.

   category =  {
     ? tc: uint .default 0
   }

   ; rate-limit indicates various rates (committed, excess, and peak).
   ; Only CIR/CBS are mandatory to include.

   rate-limit =  {
     cir: uint,          ; Mbps
     cbs: uint .gt 0,    ; bytes
     ? eir: uint,        ; Mbps
     ? ebs: uint .gt 0,  ; bytes
     ? pir: uint,        ; Mbps
     ? pbs: uint .gt 0,  ; bytes
   }

5.2.  Structure of a Throuput Advice Instance

   This section defines the set of attributes that are included in a
   throuput advice instance:

   Optional Parameter Flags (OPF):  These flags indicate the presence of
      some optional parameters.  The following flags are defined (from
      MSB to LSB):

      E:  When set to "1", this flag indicates the presence of Excess
         Information Rate (EIR).

         When set to "0", this flag indicates that EIR is not present.

      P:  When set to "1", this flag indicates the presence of Peak
         Information Rate (PIR).

         When set to "0", this flag indicates that PIR is not present.

      U:  Unassigned bits.  See Section 9.2.

   Flow flags (FF):  These flags are used to express some generic
      properties of the flow.  The following flags are defined (from MSB
      to LSB):

      S (Scope):  Specifies whether the policy is per host (when set to
         "1") or per subscriber (when set to "0).

      D (Direction):  Indicates the direction on which to apply the
         enclosed policy.

         When set to "00b", this flag indicates that this policy is for
         network-to-host direction.

         When set to "01b", this flag indicates that this policy is for
         host-to-network direction.

         When set to "10b", this flag indicates that this policy is for
         both network-to-host and host-to-network directions.

      R (Reliablity):  Indicates the reliability type of traffic on
         which to apply the enclosed policy.

         When set to "00b", this flag indicates that this policy is for
         both reliable and unreliable traffic.

         When set to "01b", this flag indicates that this policy is for
         unreliable traffic.

         When set to "10b", this flag indicates that this policy is for
         reliable traffic.

         No meaning is associated with setting the field to "11b".  Such
         value MUST be silently ignored by the receiver.

      U:  Unassigned flags.  See Section 9.3.

   TC (Traffic Category):  Specifies a traffic category to which this
      policy applies.

      The following values are supported:

      *  "0": All traffic.  This is the default value.

      *  "1": Streaming

      *  "2": Real-time

      *  "3": Bulk traffic

      *  4-63: Unassigned values.  See Section 9.4.

   Committed Information Rate (CIR) (Mbps):  Specifies the maximum
      number of bits that a network can receive or send during one
      second over a network attachment for a traffic category.

      If set to 0 (or a very low value), this indicates to the host that
      an alternate path (if any) should be preferred over this one.

      This parameter is mandatory.

   Committed Burst Size (CBS) (bytes):  Specifies the maximum burst size
      that can be transmitted at CIR.

      MUST be greater than zero.

      This parameter is mandatory.

   Excess Information Rate (EIR) (Mbps):  MUST be present only if the E
      flag is set to '1'.

      Specifies the maximum number of bits that a network can receive or
      send during one second over a network attachment for a traffic
      category that is out of profile.

      This parameter is optional.

   Excess Burst Size (EBS) (bytes):  MUST be present only if EIR is also
      present.

      Indicates the maximum excess burst size that is allowed while not
      complying with the CIR.

      MUST be greater than zero, if present.

      This parameter is optional.

   Peak Information Rate (PIR) (Mbps):  MUST be present only if P flag
      is set to '1'.

      Traffic that exceeds the CIR and the CBS is metered to the PIR.

      This parameter is optional.

   Peak Burst Size (PBS) (bytes):  MUST be present only if PIR is also
      present.

      Specifies the maximum burst size that can be transmitted at PIR.

      MUST be greater than zero, if present.

      This parameter is optional.

6.  Examples

   For the sake of illustration, Figure 3 exemplifies the content of a
   throughput advice using JSON notations.  The advice includes one
   rate-limit instance that covers network-to-host traffic direction and
   is applicable to all traffic destined to any host of a subscriber.

   {
       "throughput-advice": [
           {
               "direction": 0,
               "scope": false,
               "tc": 0,
               "cir": 50,
               "cbs": 10000
           }
       ]
   }

                          Figure 3: A JSON Example

   The advice conveyed in Figure 4 is similar to the advice in Figure 3.
   The only difference is that default values are trimmed in Figure 4.

   {
       "throughput-advice": [
           {
               "cir": 50,
               "cbs": 10000
           }
       ]
   }

            Figure 4: A JSON Example with Default Values Trimmed

   Figure 5 shows the example of an advice that encloses two instances,
   each for one traffic direction.

   {
       "throughput-advice": [
           {
               "direction": 0,
               "scope": false,
               "tc": 0,
               "cir": 50,
               "cbs": 10000
           },
           {
               "direction": 1,
               "scope": false,
               "tc": 0,
               "cir": 30,
               "cbs": 8000
           }
       ]
   }

           Figure 5: A JSON Example with Both Traffic Directions

   If both directions are covered by the same rate-limit policy, then
   the advice can be supplied as shown in Figure 6

   {
       "throughput-advice": [
           {
               "direction": 2,
               "cir": 50,
               "cbs": 10000
           }
       ]
   }

7.  Sample Uses of the Advice

   It is out of scope of this document to make recommendations about how
   the advice is consumed by applications/OS/Hosts.  A non-exhaustive
   list is provided hereafter for illustration purposes:

   *  Applications can send/receive data at a rate beyond the CIR up to
      the PIR when the network is not congested.  If network feedback
      (e.g., packet loss or delay) indicates congestion, the application
      can scale back to the CIR.  Otherwise, it can use the PIR for
      temporary throughput boosts.

   *  Applications can send/receive short-term bursts of data that
      exceed the committed burst size CBS up to the PBS if there is no
      congestion.  This is useful for scenarios where short, high-
      throughput bursts are needed.

   *  Applications can ensure that their sending rate never exceeds the
      PIR and that their short-term bursts of traffic never exceeds PBS.

8.  Security Considerations

   The throughtput advice is bound to a subscriber, a host, and traffic
   category, not individual flows.  This is consistent with, e.g.,
   Section 8.1.1 of [RFC9330] which states that "there has never been a
   universal need to police the rate of individual application flows".
   The rate-limits are set for various reasons (e.g., guards against
   resource abuse, fairness, etc.).

   As discussed in Section 4, the throughout advice assist networks to
   soften overloads during DDoS attacks, in paricular.  Of course, other
   mechanisms are enabled by networks to protect against overload (e.g.,
   DDoS mitigation [RFC8811]).

   An attacker who has the ability to change the throuput advice objects
   exchanged over a network attachment may:

   Decrease the bitrate value:  This may lower the perceived QoS if the
      host aggressively lowers its transmission rate.

   Increase the bitrate value:  The network attachment will be
      overloaded, but still the rate-limit at the network will discard
      excess traffic.

   Delete or remove the advice:  This is equivalent to deployments where
      the advice is not shared.

Appendix A.  Overview of Network Rate-Limit Policies

   As discussed, for example in [I-D.ietf-teas-5g-ns-ip-mpls], a
   provider network's inbound policy can be implemented using one of
   following options:

   *  1r2c (single-rate two-color) rate limiter

      This is the most basic rate limiter, described in Section 2.3 of
      [RFC2475].  It meters at an ingress intreface a traffic stream and
      marks its packets as in-profile (below CIR being enforced) or out-
      of-profile (above CIR being enforced).  In-profile packets are
      accepted and forwarded.  Out-of profile packets are either dropped
      right at the ingress node (hard rate limiting), or remarked (with
      different MPLS TC or DSCP TN markings) to signify 'this packet
      should be dropped in the first place, if there is a congestion'
      (soft rate limiting), depending on the business policy of the
      provider network.  In the second case, while packets above CIR are
      forwarded at an ingress node, they are subject to being dropped
      during any congestion event at any place in the provider network.

   *  2r3c (two-rate three-color) rate limiter

      This was initially defined in [RFC2698], and its improved version
      in [RFC4115].  The traffic is assigned to one of the these three
      categories:

      -  Green, for traffic under CIR

      -  Yellow, for traffic between CIR and PIR

      -  Red, for traffic above PIR

      An inbound 2r3c meter implemented with [RFC4115], compared to
      [RFC2698], is more 'customer friendly' as it doesn't impose
      outbound peak-rate shaping requirements on customer edge (CE)
      devices or hosts. 2r3c meters in general give greater flexibility
      for provider network edge enforcement regarding accepting the
      traffic (green), de-prioritizing and potentially dropping the
      traffic on transit during congestion (yellow), or hard dropping
      the traffic (red).
