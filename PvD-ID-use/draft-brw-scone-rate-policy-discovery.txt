            Discovery of Network Rate-Limit Policies (NRLPs)
              draft-brw-scone-rate-policy-discovery-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies mechanims for hosts to dynamically discover
   Network Rate-Limit Policies (NRLPs).  This information is then passed
   to applicaitons that might adjust their behaviors accordingly.

   Networks already support mechanisms to advertize a set of network
   properties to hosts using Neighbor Discovery options (e.g., link MTU
   (RFC 4861) and PREFIX64 (RFC 8781)).  This document complements these
   tools and specifies a Neighbor Discovery option to be used in Router
   Advertisements (RAs) to communicate NRLPs to hosts.  For address
   family parity, a new DHCP option is also defined.  The document also
   discusses how Provisioning Domains (PvD) can be used to notify hosts
   with NRLPs.

1.  Introduction

   To optimally deliver connectivity services via a network attachment,
   networks also advertize a set of network properties [RFC9473] to
   connected hosts such as:

   Link Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU):  For example, the 3GPP
      [TS-23.501] specifies that "the link MTU size for IPv4 is sent to
      the UE by including it in the PCO (see TS 24.501).  The link MTU
      size for IPv6 is sent to the UE by including it in the IPv6 Router
      Advertisement message (see RFC 4861)".

      Section 2.10 of [RFC7066] indicates that a cellular host should
      honor the MTU option in the Router Advertisement (Section 4.6.4 of
      [RFC4861]) given that the 3GPP system architecture uses extensive
      tunneling in its packet core network below the 3GPP link, and this
      may lead to packet fragmentation issues.

      MTU is cited as an example of path properties in Section 4 of
      [RFC9473].

   Prefixes of Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6
   clients to IPv4 servers (NAT64) [RFC8781]:  This option is useful to
      enable local DNSSEC validation, support networks with no DNS64,
      support IPv4 address literals on an IPv6-only host, etc.

      NAT is cited as an example of path properties (see "Service
      Function" bullet in Section 4 of [RFC9473]).

   Traffic exchanged over a network may be subject to rate-limit
   policies for various operational reasons.
   [I-D.brw-scone-throughput-advice-blob] specifies a generic object
   (called, Throughput Advice) that can be used by mechanims for hosts
   to dynamically discover these network rate-limit policies.  This
   information can then passed to applications that might adjust their
   behaviors accordingly.

   Given that all IPv6 hosts and networks are required to support
   Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861], this document specifies a Neighbor
   Discovery option to be used in Router Advertisements (RAs) to
   communicate rate-limit policies to hosts (Section 3).  The main
   motivations for the use of ND for such a discovery are listed in
   Section 3 of [RFC8781]:

   *  Fate sharing

   *  Atomic configuration

   *  Updatability: change the policy at any time

   *  Deployability

   For address family parity, a DHCP option [RFC2132] is also defined
   for IPv4 in Section 4.  Section 5 describes a discovery approach
   using Provisioning Domains (PvDs) [RFC8801].

   These options are called: Network Rate-Limit Policy (NRLP).

   Whether host-to-network, network-to-host, or both policies are
   returned in an NRLP is deployment specific.  All these combinations
   are supported in this document.  Also, the design supports returning
   one more NRLP instances for a given traffic direction.

   Applications will have access to all available NRLPs and will, thus,
   adjust their behavior as a function of scope and traffic category
   indicated in a policy (all traffic, for example).  An application
   that couples multiple flow types will adjust each flow type to be
   consistent with the specific policy for the relevant traffic
   category.  Likewise, a host with multiple network attachments may use
   the discovered NRLPs to decide how to distribute its flows over these
   etwork attachments (prefer an etwork attachment to place an
   application session, migrate connection, etc.).  That's said, this
   document does not make any recommendation about how a receiving host
   uses the discovered policy.

   Networks that advertize NLRPs are likely to maintain the policing in
   place within the network because of the trust model (hosts are not
   considered as trusted devices).  Per-subscriber rate-limit policies
   are generally recommended to protect nodes against Denial of Service
   (DoS) attacks (e.g., Section 9.3 of [RFC8803] or Section 8 of
   [I-D.ietf-masque-quic-proxy]).  Discussion about conditions under
   which such a trust model can be relaxed is out of scope of this
   document.

   This document does not assume nor preclude that other mechanisms,
   e.g., Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) [RFC9330],
   are enabled in a bottleneck link.  The reader may refer to I-D.brw-
   scone-manageability for a list of relevant mechanisms.

      structure of this field.

   FF (Flow flags):  6-bit flags used to express some generic properties
      of the flow.

      See Section 5 of [I-D.brw-scone-throughput-advice-blob] for the
      structure of this field.

   TC:  See Section 5 of [I-D.brw-scone-throughput-advice-blob].

   Committed Information Rate (CIR) (Mbps):  See Section 5 of [I-D.brw-s
      cone-throughput-advice-blob].

   Committed Burst Size (CBS) (bytes):  See Section 5 of [I-D.brw-scone-
      throughput-advice-blob].

   Excess Information Rate (EIR) (Mbps):  See Section 5 of [I-D.brw-scon
      e-throughput-advice-blob].  This is an optional field.

   Excess Burst Size (EBS) (bytes):  See Section 5 of [I-D.brw-scone-thr
      oughput-advice-blob].  This is an optional field.

   Peak Information Rate (PIR) (Mbps):  See Section 5 of [I-D.brw-scone-
      throughput-advice-blob].  This is an optional field.

   Peak Burst Size (PBS) (bytes):  See Section 5 of [I-D.brw-scone-throu
      ghput-advice-blob].  This is an optional field.

3.2.  IPv6 Host Behavior

   The procedure for rate-limit configuration is the same as it is with
   any other Neighbor Discovery option [RFC4861].

   The host MUST be prepared to receive multiple NRLP options in RAs;
   each with distinct scope and/or application group.

   If the host receives multiple NRLP options with overlapping scope/TC,
   the host MUST silently discard all these options.

   If the receiving host has LAN capabilities (e.g., mobile CE or mobile
   handset with tethering), the following behavior applies:

   *  If an RA NRLP is advertised from the network, and absent local
      rate-limit policies, the device should send RAs to the downstream
      attached LAN devices with the same NRLP values received from the
      network.

   *  If local rate-limit policies are provided to the device, the
      device may change the scope or values received from the network to
      accommodate these policies.  The device may decide to not relay
      received RAs to internal nodes if local policies were already
      advertized using RAs and those policies are consistent with the
      network policies.

   Applications running over a host can learn the bitrates associated
   with a network attachment by invoking a dedicated API.  The exact
   details of the API is OS-specific and, thus, out of scope of this
   document.

4.  DHCP NRLP Option

      Note that the base DHCP can only signal a rate policy change when
      the client first joins the network or renews its lease, whereas
      IPv6 ND can update the rate policy at the network's discretion.
      [RFC6704] specifies an approach for forcing reconfiguration of
      individual hosts without suffering from the limitations of the
      FORCERENEW design in [RFC3203].

4.1.  Option Format

   The format of the DHCP NRLP option is illustrated in Figure 3.

   Excess Information Rate (EIR) (Mbps):  See Section 5 of [I-D.brw-scon
      e-throughput-advice-blob].  This is an optional field.

   OPTION_V4_NRLP is a concatenation-requiring option.  As such, the
   mechanism specified in [RFC3396] MUST be used if OPTION_V4_NRLP
   exceeds the maximum DHCP option size of 255 octets.

   OPTION_V4_NRLP is permitted to be included in the RADIUS
   DHCPv4-Options Attribute [RFC9445].

4.2.  DHCPv4 Client Behavior

   To discover a network rate-limit policy, the DHCP client includes
   OPTION_V4_NRLP in a Parameter Request List option [RFC2132].

   The DHCP client MUST be prepared to receive multiple "NRLP Instance
   Data" field entries in the OPTION_V4_NRLP option; each instance is to
   be treated as a separate network rate-limit policy.

5.  Provisioning Domains

   PvD may also be used as a mechanism to discover NRLP.  Typically, the
   network will configured to set the H-flag so clients can request PvD
   Additional Information (Section 4.1 of [RFC8801]).

   Figure 6 provides an example of the returned "application/pvd+json"
   to indicate a network-to-host NRLP for all subscriber traffic.  The
   NRLP list may include multiple instances if distinct policies are to
   be returned for distinct traffic categories.

   {
      "nrlp":[
         {
            "direction":0,
            "scope":0,
            "tc":0,
            "cir":50,
            "cbs":10000,
            "ebs":20000
         }
      ]
   }

6.  Security Considerations

   The techniques discussed in the document offer the following security
   benefit: An OS can identify the type of application (background,
   foreground, streaming, real-time, etc.) and enforce appropriate
   network policies, even if a misbehaving application tries to evade
   the rate-limit policies.  If an application attempts to bypass rate-
   limiting by changing its 5-tuple or creating multiple flows, the OS
   can detect this and manage the application's traffic accordingly.

6.1.  ND

   As discussed in [RFC8781], because RAs are required in all IPv6
   configuration scenarios, RAs must already be secured, e.g., by
   deploying an RA-Guard [RFC6105].  Providing all configuration in RAs
   reduces the attack surface to be targeted by malicious attackers
   trying to provide hosts with invalid configuration, as compared to
   distributing the configuration through multiple different mechanisms
   that need to be secured independently.

   RAs are already used in mobile networks to advertize the link MTU.
   The same security considerations for MTU discovery apply for the NRLP
   discover.

   An attacker who has access to the RAs exchanged over an AC may:

   Decrease the bitrate:  This may lower the perceived QoS if the host
      aggressively lowers its transmission rate.

   Increase the bitrate value:  The AC will be overloaded, but still the
      rate-limit at the network will discard excess traffic.

   Drop RAs:  This is similar to the current operations, where no NRLP
      RA is shared.

   Inject fake RAs:  The implications are similar to the impacts of
      tweaking the values of a legitimate RA.

6.2.  DHCP

   An attacker who has access to the DHCP exchanged over an AC may do a
   lot of harm (e.g., prevent access to the network).

   The following mechanisms may be considered to mitigate spoofed or
   modified DHCP responses:

   DHCPv6-Shield [RFC7610]:  The network access node (e.g., a border
      router, a CPE, an Access Point (AP)) discards DHCP response
      messages received from any local endpoint.

   Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) solution for DHCP
   [RFC7513]:  The network access node filters packets with forged
      source IP addresses.

   The above mechanisms would ensure that the endpoint receives the
   correct NRLP information, but these mechanisms cannot provide any
   information about the DHCP server or the entity hosting the DHCP
   server.

Appendix A.  Example of Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
             (AAA)

   Figure 7 provides an example of the exchanges that might occur
   between a DHCP server and an Authentication, Authorization, and
   Accounting (AAA) server to retrieve the per-subscriber NRLPs.

   This example assumes that the Network Access Server (NAS) embeds both
   Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) [RFC2865] client
   and DHCP server capabilities.
